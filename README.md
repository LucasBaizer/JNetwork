#What is JNetwork?
JNetwork is a simple, lightweight, easy-to-use solution for making Java's Sockets easier. 
It includes several utilities for creating servers, creating clients, encrypting and decryping objects,
and passing objects and files between servers and clients. As of 10/22/16, JNetwork supports both TCP and UDP protocols. It also has a lightweight SQL-like database protocol.
All jars have a built-in source attachment with documentation.
