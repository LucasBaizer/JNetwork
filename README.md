#What is JNetwork?
JNetwork is a simple, lightweight, and documented Java networking library. It provides support for TCP and UDP connections, and also SSL 
over TCP. Although it does not currently support mainstream DTLS, it has an API-level secure UDP protocol, named Secure Datagram Transport Protocol (or SDTP). JNetwork also has a simple SQL-like database protocol. All of the jars have built-in source attachments.

#Examples
All examples can be found [here](src/example).
