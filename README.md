# What is JNetwork?
JNetwork is a simple, lightweight, abstract, no-dependency, and thoroughly documented Java networking library. It provides support for several common protocols. These protocols include:<br>
* Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
* Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)
* Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
* User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
* Secure Socket Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS)

JNetwork also has two protocols defined by and implemented by the API _for the purpose of showing how to create a custom protocol with JNetwork. They are not completely secure._ These protocols are:
* Secure Datagram Transmission Protocol (SDTP), an AES-based secure UDP implementation
* JNetwork-Level Secure TCP (JLST), an AES-based secure TCP implementation

JNetwork also has a simple SQL-like database protocol. All of the jars have built-in source attachments.
