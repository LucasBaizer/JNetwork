#What is JNetwork?
JNetwork is a simple, lightweight, and documented Java networking library. It provides support for several common protocols. These protocols include:<br>
* Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
* User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
* Secure Socket Layer (SSL)

JNetwork also has two protocols defined by and implemented by the API. These protocols are:
* Secure Datagram Transmission Protocol (SDTP), an AES-based secure UDP implementation
* JNetwork-Level Secure TCP (JLST), an AES-based secure TCP implementation

JNetwork also has a simple SQL-like database protocol. All of the jars have built-in source attachments.
